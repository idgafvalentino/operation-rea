  "description": "As the mayor of a small economically depressed town, you must decide whether to approve a new mining operation. The mine would create 500 well-paying jobs in a community with 15% unemployment and revitalize the local economy. However, environmental assessments indicate it would likely cause significant damage to a nearby river ecosystem that contains several endangered species and provides clean water to downstream communities. The mining company has proposed some mitigation measures but acknowledges they cannot eliminate all environmental risks. Local opinion is sharply divided between those who prioritize economic opportunity and those who value environmental protection.",
