  "title": "Parent-Child Medical Dilemma: Religious Beliefs vs. Medical Necessity",
  "description": "You are a doctor treating a 14-year-old with leukemia. The standard treatment protocol has a 70% chance of success, but requires multiple blood transfusions. The child's parents are devout members of a religion that prohibits blood transfusions on theological grounds. The child, though frightened, expresses desire to receive treatment despite their religious upbringing. The parents are attempting to legally block the treatment. As the doctor, the hospital legal team has informed you that a court order allowing treatment could be obtained, but it would take several days during which the child's condition might deteriorate significantly. Should you respect the parents' religious autonomy, wait for legal intervention, or pursue emergency treatment against their wishes?",
